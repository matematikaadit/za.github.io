Since, this is a static blog, I am considering to add disqus so that users could leave their comments. I followed [instructions](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) from there, but instead put the include comments.html at layouts/default.html, I put it at layouts/posts.html

So now please, feel free to leave your feedbacks! 

PS: Sorry, I still must figure out how to write code snippets or variables using markdown format.
