![PyCon APAC 2014 Group Photo](/images/pyconapac2014-group-photo.jpg)

I haven't written [PyCon APAC 2014](http://apac.pycon.org) wrap up. I'll share my experience by attending this conference, at Python Indonesia meetup this [Saturday](http://www.python.or.id/2014/05/kopi-darat-python-indonesia-juni-2014.html). For those who are impatient, you may read these blog posts:
