I love taking scenic view with panorama. It reminds me how does it feel to see the beautiful scene. This one was taken at Xiuguluan River, Hsinchu, Taipei. While waiting, we walked around the venue. The rafting it self took almost 3 hours with more than 20 km. The view was more breath taking from the boat. Too bad, none of us bring camera/smartphone to capture those stunning view.
