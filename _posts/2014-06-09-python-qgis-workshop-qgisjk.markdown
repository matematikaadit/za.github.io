I had wrote my reviews on Python QGIS Workshop. They are, in terms of [technical](http://zakiakhmad.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/python-qgis-workshop-qgisjk/) and also [non-technical](http://blogs.itb.ac.id/zakiakhmad/2014/06/09/review-pelaksanaan-workshop-python-qgis-qgisjk/) (how the workshop was held, I wrote it in Bahasa Indonesia). 

Enjoy! And you can also check [the house finder plugin](https://github.com/za/housefinder-qgisjk) which created during the workshop. This plugin will calculate the shortest distance from one point to any other Point of Interests in the area.
