Yes! We just had another [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Python-ID/events/187061422/). We have four speakers (including me!). I have posted my slides at [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/za/cerita-dari-pycon-apac-2014). I was sharing my experience from attending the PyCon APAC 2014. So, basically my talk was not a technical talk.  

It's just another amazing meetup for me. It was very nice, to meet and chat with people who share the same enthusiast and interest. Well, in the end it's something personal. Something you could only feel it by attending (and actively participating) at meetup. Thank you guys!
